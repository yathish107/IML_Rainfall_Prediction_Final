# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast rainfall using various meteorological parameters. The dataset is analyzed and visualized using Python, and several machine learning models are tested to determine the best performing one.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all the data preprocessing, visualization, model building, training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy & Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various meteorological attributes like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc., and the target is to predict whether rainfall will occur.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Classification model implementation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics
- Final comparison of model performances

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd rainfall-prediction
   jupyter notebook Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells sequentially to train and evaluate the models.

## ✅ Results

The notebook compares multiple models and identifies the best performing one based on standard classification metrics.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Deployment using Flask or Streamlit for web interface
- Incorporation of more advanced models like XGBoost or LSTM (for time series)
